# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and identify factors that contribute to churn, enabling telecom companies to take proactive measures to retain customers.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Logistic Regression (or any other model used)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Collection:** Imported customer dataset containing various features such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and payment method.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Scaled numerical features for better model performance  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Used histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand customer behavior  
   - Identified key patterns that influence customer churn  
4. **Model Building & Evaluation:**  
   - Applied machine learning models to predict customer churn  
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
5. **Insights & Business Impact:**  
   - Derived actionable insights to reduce churn  
   - Recommended strategies based on data analysis  

## ðŸ“Œ Outcomes  
- Identified high-risk customer segments prone to churn  
- Suggested data-driven strategies for customer retention  
- Improved understanding of churn patterns through visualization and machine learning  

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis and model.  

## ðŸ“œ Conclusion  
This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in the telecom industry. By leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can improve customer retention and enhance profitability.
